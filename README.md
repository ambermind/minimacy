# MINIMACY

Computing is something too serious to be left to machines.
Humans must be able to understand 100% of what's going on in the machine. Otherwise, there can be no serious talk of cybersecurity or sovereignty.
No technology allows it today... except MINIMACY!

MINIMACY is an open-source minimalist computation system based on the principle “Less is more”, so that a single human can understand 100% of the system operation.
It is designed and programmed by [Sylvain Huet](https://sylvain-huet.com/).
