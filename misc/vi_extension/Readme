Minimacy extension for Vi/Vim
-----------------------------

Setup
-----
- copy the directory .vim in your home directory
- when you do not have any .vimrc file, copy the .vimrc file from this extension
- else open your .vimrc file and insert the content of the .vimrc file from this extension

Troubleshooting
---------------
Syntax highlighting requires the "Huge version" of Vi/Vim.
On some distributions (including Ubuntu) the default version is the "Small version".

With the "Small version", you get the following error:

$ vi
Error detected while processing /home/[username]/.vimrc:
line    1:
E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version: syntax on

You may check your current version and observe that you have the "Small version":
$ vi --version

^^^^^

In this situation, you need to upgrade vim, by simply typing the following command:
$ sudo apt-get install vim

Now you may check that you have the "Huge version":
$ vi --version

And vi won't fail anymore.
